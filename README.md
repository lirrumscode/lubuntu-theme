A _Superminimal_, _dark_ Color Theme. This is the first major version of the **Lubuntu** theme. It's a _dark_ syntax theme crafted especially for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) [New Version], with subtle colors that are meant to be easy on the eyes and is a huge quick win if you like Lubuntu linux distribution.
